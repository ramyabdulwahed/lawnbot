#Serial communication is a way for two devices (e.g., a Raspberry Pi and a motor controller) to talk to each other by sending one piece of data at a time over a wire.
#  in python we use the serial lib to open that channel and send strings

############################# big picture tracing for the program #########################################
# 1. main_logic controller subscribes to /path (for movement path commands) 
# 2. main_logic_controller receives a path message: ex. MotorData(op_code='D', position=1000, speed=300) 
# 3. it publishes it to: Topic: /motor_output Message Type: MotorData 
# 4. motor controller is subsribed to it thus it revices the message and triggers motor_output_callback() which formats the command and sends it over to kangaroo 
# 5. after sending we can start the timer service /motor_start  which repeadelty calls get_completion_status() every 0.1s, 
#  until we get p we publish done to /motion_completed.
